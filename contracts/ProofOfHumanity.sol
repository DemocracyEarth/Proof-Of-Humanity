 *  @title ProofOfHumanity
 *  This contract is a curated registry for people. The users are identified by their address and can be added or removed through the request-challenge protocol.
 *  In order to challenge a registration request the challenger must provide one of the four reasons.
 *  New requests firstly should gain sufficient amount of vouches from other registered users and only after that they can be accepted or challenged.
 *  The users who vouched for submission that lost the challenge with the reason Duplicate or DoesNotExist would be penalized with optional fine or ban period.
 *  NOTE: This contract trusts that the Arbitrator is honest and will not reenter or modify its costs during a call.
 *  The arbitrator must support appeal period.
